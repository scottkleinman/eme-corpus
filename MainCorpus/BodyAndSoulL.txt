Als i lay in a winteris nyt
In a droukening bifor þe day
Vor soþe i sauȝ a selly syt
A body on a bere lay
Þat havede ben a mody knyȝt
And lutel served god to payȝ

Þe gost was oute and scholde away
Wan þe gost it scholde go

Biheold the body þere it cam fro
So serfulli with dredli mod

Wo worþe þi fleys þi foule blod
Wreche bodi wȝy listouȝ so
Þat ȝwilene were so wilde and wod
Þow þat were woned to ride
Heyȝe on horse in and out
So koweynte knit ikud so wide
As a lyun fers and proud

And þi lede þat was so loud

Ȝwere beon þi castles and þi toures
Þi chaumbres and þi riche halles
Ipeynted with so riche floures
And þi riche robes alle

Wrechede it is nouȝ þi bour
To moruwe þouȝ schalt þerinne falle
Ȝwere ben þine cokes snelle
Þat scholden gon greiþe þi mete
With speces swete for to smelle
Þat þouȝ neuere were fol of frete
To do þat foule fleys to suwelle
Þat foule wormes scholden ete
And þouȝ hauest þe pine of helle
With glotonye me bigete
For god schop be aftir his schap
And gaf þe boþe wyt and skil
In þi loking was i laft
To wisse aftir þin oune wil
Ne toc i nevere wychecraft
Ne wist i ȝwat was guod nor il

For frendes eyȝe þat þe stod to

And al mi love on þe i kest

And let þe haven ro and rest
Þat made þe so sturne of mod
And of werkes so vnwrest
To fiȝte with þe ne was no bot

To god of hevene and alle hise
And in unlust for to lye

And þouȝ witest me þat no guod couþe

Of sum merci to don us bot

And þouȝ schalt comen with fleys and felle

Reuliche toyled to and fro
For thei weren ragged rone and tayled
With brode bulches on here bac
Scharpe clauwes longe nayled
No was no lime withoute lac
On alle halve it was asayled
With mani a devel foul and blac
Merci criende lutel availede
Ȝwan Crist it wolde so harde wrac
Some þe chaules it towrasten
And ȝoten in þe led al hot
And bedin him to drinke faste
And senke abouten him a brod
A devil kam þer ate laste
Þat was maister wel i wot
A colter glowende in him he þraste
Þat it þoruȝ þe herte it smot
Gleyves glowende some setten
To bac and brest and boþe sides
Þat in his herte þe poyntes mettin
And maden him þo woundes wide
And seiden him fol wel he lette
Þe herte þat was so fol of pride
Wel he it hadde þat men him bihette
For more scholde it bitide
Wordly wedes for to were
Þei seiden þat he lovede best
A develes cope for to bere
Al brennynde on him was kest
With hote haspes imad to spere
Þat streite sat to bac and brest
An helm þat was lutel to here
Kam him and an hors al prest
Forth was brouȝt here with a bridel
A corsed devel als a cote
Þat grisliche grennede and ȝenede wide
Þe leyȝe it lemede of his þrote
With a sadel to the midside
Fol of scharpe pikes schote
Alse an hechele onne to ride
Al was glowende ilke a grote
Opon þat sadil he was sloungen
As he scholde to þe tornement
An hundred devel on him dongen
Her and þer þan he was hent
With hote speres þoruȝ was stongen
And wiþ oules al torent
At ilke a dint þe sparkles sprongen
As of a brond þat were forbrend
Ȝwan he hadde riden þat rode
Opon þe sadil þer he was set
He was kast doun as a tode
And hellehoundes to him were led
Þat broiden out þo peces brode
Als he to helle ward was fet
Ther alle þe fendes fet it trode
Men miȝte of blod foluwe þe tred
He beden him hontin and blowen
Crien on Bauston and Bewis
Þe ratches þat him were woned te knowen

An hundred develes ratches on a rowe
With stringes him drowen unþanc his
Til he kome to þat lodli lowe
Þer helle was i wot to wis

Þe fendes kasten suwilk a ȝel
Þe erþe it openede anon

Men myȝte fif mile have þe smel
Loverd wo schal him be bigon
Þat haþ þeroffe be tenþe del

And seide Jhesu Crist that sittest on hey
On me þi schap nouȝ have merci

To be þus togged and totoren
And oþere to haven al mi wele
Þo þat scholden be forlorn
Wretches þat tou miȝtest spele
A weile wȝi lestouȝ hem be born
To ȝeve þe foule fend so fele
Agein him þe fendes gonnen criȝe
Caitif helpeþ þe na more
To calle on Jhesus ne Marie
Ne to crie Cristes ore
Loren þouȝ havest the cumpainye
Þou havest served us so ȝore
Þarfore nou þou schalt abye
As oþere þat leven on oure lore
Þe foule fendes þat weren fayn
Bi top and tail he slongen hit
And kesten it with myȝt and mayn
Doun into the develes pit
Þer sonne ne schal nevere be seyn
Hemself he sonken in þermit

Anon þe donge it was fordit
Wȝan it was forth þat foule lod
To hellewel or it were day
Ou ilk a her a drope stod
For friȝt and fer þer as i lay

Þat schilde me fram mani a qued
A sunful man as i lai þore
Þo þat sunfol ben i rede hem red
