And some bi heore tresses longue
Heore peynes forto lienge
Some bi hondene and bi armes
And some bi heore erene and bi þe þarmes
And some bi heore toungues hienge
Powel lokede him bi side
And saiȝh a flod in helle glide

Some ase fisches in þe se
And some ase wormes fierden heo

A ful heiȝh brugge and vnguod

To habbe redie passage
To laten þe guode soules pase
To seon oure louerdes grace
With oute ani rage

And sunfole gostus þaron þicke
For soþe ieh eov segge

And inte helle pine hem castez

Nis no toungue þat al may telle
Of þe strongue peynes of helle

And lokede into þat foule flod

Some to heore kneos woden
And some to hore naueles stoden
And some to heore eyȝen
Some to heore brouwes stoden þer in
And some to þe mouþes also swyn
And some to heore chynne

So weren þei dreinte in þat flode
For heore dedlich sunne

Heore Joye was more to seon and heore
Of þeire neyȝhebores teone

And blake weren heore cloþus
