A Mayde cristes me bit yorne

For hwan heo myhte best ileorne

Þat treowest were of alle berne

And is byset so felevolde

Þeos þeines þat her weren bolde

Vnder molde hi liggeþ colde

Nis no mon iboren o lyue

For her he haueþ seorewen ryue

Toward his ende he hyeþ blyue

Nis non so riche ne non so freo

Ne may hit neuer his waraunt beo

Ne beo he no þe swift ne may he fleo

Þus is þes world as þu mayht seo

Þis world fareþ hwilynde

Forþi he doþ as þe blynde

Þeo luue þat ne may her abyde

And fromward in vychon tide

Monnes luue nys buten o stunde

His luue is her and ek a lunde

An ende hwat helpeþ hit to hele

Hwer is paris and heleyne

Heo beoþ iglyden vt of þe reyne

And hwat hi þoleden alyue here

Þeyh he were so riche mon

Al were sone his prute agon

Of lufsum lost of truste treowe

He is ricchest mon of londe

Henri king of engelonde 
of hym he halt and to hym buhþ
Mayde to þe he send his sonde

Ne byt he wiþ þe lond ne leode

If þu him woldest luue beode

Hwat spekestu of eny bolde

Þer ne may no freond fleon oþer

And yeue him god endynge
